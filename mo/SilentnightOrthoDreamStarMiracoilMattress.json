[{"__typename":"Product","_id":"81","title":"Silentnight Ortho Dream Star Miracoil Mattress","description":"The **Silentnight Ortho Dream Star Mattress** is built using Silentnight's remarkable **Miracoil** spring system with extra firm support,\ncovered with a thick layer of soft supportive fillings for extra comfort, and finished off with a cover of deeply quilted damask fabric.\nAs one of Silentnight's firmest mattresses, the aptly named **Ortho Dream Star** is perfect for anyone looking for a really firm supportive feel.\n\nMiracoil springs innovatively prevents the unpleasant roll-together effect sometimes found in cheaper mattresses, by running the springs\nfrom top-to-bottom in the mattress rather than from side-to-side. This provides separate sleeping regions for each partner - as demonstrated\nby Silentnight's well-known hippo and duck.\n\nAnother benefit of **Miracoil** is the way mattress is arranged into three different comfort and support zones - Silentnight make sure to give\nstronger support the heavier areas of your body, and mellower support for your head and neck. The aim is to provide the support you need,\nno matter your body type.\n\nThe Ortho Dream Star comes complete with breathable and fresh **Eco Comfort Fibres™** that help keep you cool while you sleep. Made from 100%\nsustainable sources, you can enjoy eco-friendly comfort that helps to care for our planet.\n\nThe **Silentnight Ortho Dream Star Mattress** is **hypoallergenic** and resists dust mites, making it a great choice for allergy sufferers, or\nindeed anyone who wants a healthy night's sleep.","images":[{"__typename":"Asset","_id":"1","title":"","altText":"","file":{"variations":[{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"original","width":964,"height":603,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/full/ortho-dream-star-mattress-full-2017.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"lg","width":964,"height":603,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/full/ortho-dream-star-mattress-full-2017.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"sm","width":280,"height":175,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/280x175/ortho-dream-star-mattress-full-2017.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"xs","width":65,"height":40,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/65x40/ortho-dream-star-mattress-full-2017.jpg"}]}},{"__typename":"Asset","_id":"1","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdiLSQLxJQY"},{"__typename":"Asset","_id":"1","title":"","altText":"","file":{"variations":[{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"original","width":964,"height":603,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/full/ortho-dream-star-corner-shot-2017.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"lg","width":964,"height":603,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/full/ortho-dream-star-corner-shot-2017.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"sm","width":280,"height":175,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/280x175/ortho-dream-star-corner-shot-2017.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"xs","width":65,"height":40,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/65x40/ortho-dream-star-corner-shot-2017.jpg"}]}},{"__typename":"Asset","_id":"1","title":"","altText":"","file":{"variations":[{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"original","width":964,"height":603,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/full/cloud9-brass-elizabeth-bedstead-brass-finials.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"lg","width":964,"height":603,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/full/cloud9-brass-elizabeth-bedstead-brass-finials.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"sm","width":280,"height":175,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/280x175/cloud9-brass-elizabeth-bedstead-brass-finials.jpg"},{"__typename":"ImageVariation","contentType":"image/jpeg","name":"xs","width":65,"height":40,"url":"https://cdn.mattressonline.co.uk/content/products/65x40/cloud9-brass-elizabeth-bedstead-brass-finials.jpg"}]}}],"reviews":{"__typename":"ProductReviewScore","score":8.9,"number":3168},"properties":[{"__typename":"Property","name":"Mattress/Size","label":"Mattress Size","options":[{"__typename":"PropertyOption","name":"double","label":"Double","properties":[{"__typename":"Property","name":"Width","units":"cm","value":135},{"__typename":"Property","name":"Length","units":"cm","value":190},{"__typename":"Property","name":"Width","units":"in","value":54},{"__typename":"Property","name":"Length","units":"in","value":75}]}]},{"__typename":"Property","name":"Mattress/Structure","label":"Structure","options":[{"__typename":"PropertyOption","name":"miracoil-springs","label":"Miracoil Springs","content":"Silentnight's world-famous Miracoil spring system is designed to offer perfect anatomical support for a restful night's sleep.
